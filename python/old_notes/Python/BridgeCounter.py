'''
1: Count how many cards you and the dummy have in the suit
2: Subtract the number of cards you and the dummy have from 13
   to get the number of cards your opponents have in that suit
3: Each time you lead the suit and both opponents follow suit
   subtract two from the number of cards your opponents have left
4: when your opponents have no cards left, all your remaining small cards
   are winning tricks.
   with this trick, the numbers get smaller and become easier to work with.
